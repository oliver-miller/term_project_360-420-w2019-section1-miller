# Code

Place the code you developped for the term project in this folder. Add any instructions/documentation required to run the code, and what results can be expected in this *README* file.

How to reproduce my results:
- Run the java file "IVTheoretical.java"
    - This will produce an I-V graph of a tunnel diode based on pre-exisiting equations developped by a SPICE
       behavioral model (there will also be a text files with all of the values needed to make this graph)
- Run the java file "TDOscillator.java"
    - This is will produce a V vs t graph of a tunnel diode oscilator produced by a set of ODEs
